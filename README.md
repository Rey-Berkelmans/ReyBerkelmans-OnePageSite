# Notes
This website took several hours to complete.

The most difficult aspect of creating this website was implementing JavaScript to work with the HTML code. A large amount of JavaScript code I wished to add was removed due to errors and it not working.

The main issue with this website was time restrictions preventing me from working on errors to allow me to add more JavaScript in this code.

# Reflection
If given the chance to redo this website, I would like to spend more time working on it in order to get more of the JavaScript code working and make the website more unique.

I am also not the most experienced with coding, and therefore if I had to work on this website again I would like to spend more time researching how to code different assignments.
