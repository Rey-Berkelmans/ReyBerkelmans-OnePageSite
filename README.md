# Notes
This website took several hours to complete.

Attached below is features of this website.

1. A pop-up when users access the website.
2. A slideshow of three different images.
3. A interactable button that allows users to view the time.
4. Website has been edited to have an appealing design for viewers.

Attached below is the key issues of this website.

1. Majority of this code is HTML. Website could benefit from more CSS and JavaScript code.
2. Much of the JavaScript code had to be removed due to errors with the code. Website could benefit if more time was spent dealing with these errors.
3. Website would benefit for more information added into the body of this website.
4. Website would benefit for more time spent on the website's design.

# Reflection
If given the chance to redo this website, I would like to spend more time working on it in order to get more of the JavaScript code working and make the website more unique.

I am also not the most experienced with coding, and therefore if I had to work on this website again I would like to spend more time researching how to code different websites.

This website is successful, but could be greatly improved like most things. This website could heavily benefit from more JavaScript code and customisation, which would be possible if I had spent more time working on this website and its code.
