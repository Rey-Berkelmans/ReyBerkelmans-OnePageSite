# Notes
This website took several hours to complete.

The most difficult aspect of creating this website was implementing JavaScript to work with the HTML code. A large amount of JavaScript code I wished to add was removed due to errors with the code.

The majority of this code in this website is HTML, but this website would benefit from more CSS and JavaScript code.

# Reflection
If given the chance to redo this website, I would like to spend more time working on it in order to get more of the JavaScript code working and make the website more unique.

I am also not the most experienced with coding, and therefore if I had to work on this website again I would like to spend more time researching how to code different assignments.

This website is successful, but could be greatly improved like most things. This website could heavily benefit from more JavaScript code and customisation.
